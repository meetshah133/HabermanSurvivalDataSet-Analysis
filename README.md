# HabermanSurvivalDataSet-Analysis
The project consist of analysis and classification done on the Heberman Survival Data Set which contains cases from a study 
that was conducted between 1958 and 1970 at the University of Chicago's Billings Hospital on the survival of patients who had 
undergone surgery for breast cancer.

The dataset is taken from kaggle

I have done exploratory data analysis to understand the data set and the key observations are written in the ipython notebook
I have used KNN Classification to classify the status of the patient given the age and number of nodes.
